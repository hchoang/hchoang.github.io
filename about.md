Hi there, my name is Huy Cat Hoang, just call me Cat. I am a software developer living in Sydney, Australia. I have a strong background in Software Engineering and have just finished my Master of Information Technology from the University of Technology Sydney.

Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects building back-end service for web applications. I have experiences with multiple PHP frameworks i.e. Laravel4, Symfony2. I am open to new challenges at the moment, so please [contact me](mailto:cat.hoanghuy@gmail.com) if you want me to be part of your team, cheers!!!
