So another year already passed, it has been really quick, I still remember the same day last year, I was in Vietnam, with my newlywed wife, and worried about the future. I just finish my Master degree at that time and was working in Woolworths. I earned 500 a week at that time, and now with a family. I worried that I can't afford to feed it. And now I am sitting at my desk, working as a full-time employee, earning a decent amount of money, and writing a blog to tell people how exciting I am about the up comming baby.

##Achivement list

- Found an office job: I worked for a pharmacy since I first came to Australia, It is a well paid job and the job fitted me well before. However, I just start a new family and I reckon it's time for me to move up the next level where I can advance my career in the future.
- Paid dept
- Gained weight: I gained 6kg since the begin of the year, it's a big achivement for me.
- Started listening to podcast: I am aware about podcast for a while, but I didn't start listening to it. Now I listen to podcast everyday, it makes my commute so much more productive.
- Started writing and reading again

##Overall
This year has been good, no, I have to say EXTREMELY good. I can't describe how happy I am right now when I look back and write off items that I want to achive at the beginning of the year.
