*Disclaimer: I write this post is to share with others the experience that I have during the process of setting up MY COMPUTER (using Mac OSX) to learn how to program on an Arduino device. This is not a complete tutorial in which covers different OSes. This blog also reflects my knowledge about the topic at the time of writing, please be aware of that.*

###Why I choose Arduino?

I recently joined a company which provides a healthcare service using a small device to monitor patients' health. I am assigned the task to develop the firmware for the new device. My background is a software engineer, moving to an electronic engineer has a very steep learning curl. I really want a device that I can learn how to work with. After researching, I found Arduino is a good solution for that so I log on my eBay account and get one. I recommend that if you can, get a complete kit with a breadboard, jumper wire, and resistor, it is cheaper in the end and save you some time when you want to expand your project.

###What kit did I choose?

For my need, I want a board with Bluetooth support, that why I choose DFRobot's starter kit. I think this kit is good for a very beginner, who does not have any idea about electronic (like me), as everything is just plugged and play.  

###Step 1: Download Arduino IDE

After getting your kit, you must get a IDE to work with Arduino. You can [go here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to download the IDE of your system.
