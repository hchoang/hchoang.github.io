My name is Cat Hoang, a Vietnamese Software Engineer, currently living in Sydney Australia. People say that I am a quiet guy but I do love to talk, my favourite topics: life and religion.

I love reading books. When I was young, nap time after lunch is a very common thing in my country, my mother always tried to make that a habit for me, but she had never been successful. Instead of napping, I often spent my time reading. My father has a huge bookshelf, the perk of it is that I never run out of books to read.
